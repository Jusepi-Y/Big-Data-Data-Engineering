# Medical Information Dashboard Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of key medical parameters from patient records, visualized through Power BI and presented in a professional data analysis report. The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and demographic variables such as gender and race.

## Project Structure

- `Medical_Information_Dashboard.pdf`: The original dashboard file visualizing the data.
- `Big_Data_Assignment.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook with additional analysis and insights.
- `Data_Analysis_Report.md`: The main report detailing the analysis and key findings.

## Key Findings

1. BMI Differences by Gender: Notable differences in average BMI between males and females.
2. Cholesterol Levels by Race: Higher cholesterol observed in Black and White patients.
3. Correlation of Blood Pressure Metrics: Positive correlation between systolic and diastolic pressures.
4. Systolic Pressure vs Cholesterol: A relationship showing higher cholesterol linked to increased systolic pressure.
